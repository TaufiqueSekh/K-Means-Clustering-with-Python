# K-Means-Clustering-with-Python

## Introduction to K-Means Clustering 

Machine learning algorithms can be broadly classified into two categories - supervised and unsupervised learning. There are other categories also like semi-supervised learning and reinforcement learning. But, most of the algorithms are classified as supervised or unsupervised learning. The difference between them happens because of presence of target variable. In unsupervised learning, there is no target variable. The dataset only has input variables which describe the data. This is called unsupervised learning.

K-Means clustering is the most popular unsupervised learning algorithm. It is used when we have unlabelled data which is data without defined categories or groups. The algorithm follows an easy or simple way to classify a given data set through a certain number of clusters, fixed apriori. K-Means algorithm works iteratively to assign each data point to one of K groups based on the features that are provided. Data points are clustered based on feature similarity.

K-Means clustering can be represented diagrammatically as follows:-
